<!-- JavaScript Variables
            4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable: Using var, Using let, Using const, Using nothing

<--------------------------------------------variable-----------------------------------------

What are Variables?
            Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).            

keep in mind
            The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
            The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
            If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.
            If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.


JavaScript Identifiers
            All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.These unique names are called identifiers.
            Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
            
            The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
                            Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
                            Names must begin with a letter.
                            Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
                            Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
                            Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
            Note
                JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.


JavaScript Data Types
            JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".               
            In programming, text values are called text strings.                
            JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.               
            Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.                
            If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.       

            Example....>>>> const pi = 3.14; let person = "John Doe"; let answer = 'Yes I am!';


Declaring a JavaScript Variable
            Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
            var carName; let carName;
                After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).            
                To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:carName = "Volvo";

Re-Declaring a JavaScript Variable
            A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined. 
                eg- > let a; a will give undefined
            If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.
                let a = 2; let a; a will give 2


Note.......>>>
            You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.
            This will not work: let carName = "Volvo"; let carName;


Note .......>>>
            If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings,
             and concatenated.


JavaScript Dollar Sign $
            Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:
            Example .......>>> let $ = "Hello World"; let $$$ = 2; let $myMoney = 5; //will give 7

            Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often
              use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library. In the JavaScript library
              jQuery, for instance, the main function $ is used to select HTML elements. In jQuery $("p"); 
              means "select all p elements".
 


JavaScript Underscore (_)
            Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter,identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:
              
            Example .......>>> let _lastName = "Johnson"; let _x = 2; let _100 = 5;
               Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional
               programmers is to use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables.              
             


<--------------------------------------------let-----------------------------------------     

JavaScript Let
            The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
            Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
            Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.
            Variables defined with let have Block Scope.

Block Scope
            Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.           
            ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.           
            These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.            
            Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:            
            Example
                    {
                    let x = 2;
                    }
                    // x can NOT be used here

            Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.            
            Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.            
            Example
                    {
                    var x = 2;
                    }
                    // x CAN be used here

                    
Redeclaring Variables
            Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.
            Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block:
            Example
                    var x = 10;
                    // Here x is 10
                    {
                    var x = 2;
                    // Here x is 2
                    }
                    // Here x is 2

            Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem.
            Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block:
            Example
                    let x = 10;
                    // Here x is 10
                    {
                    let x = 2;
                    // Here x is 2
                    }
                    // Here x is 10


Let Hoisting
            Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.
            Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:
            Example
                    This is OK:
                    carName = "Volvo";
                    var carName;
where as we cant do this with let


<--------------------------------------------Const-----------------------------------------     


JavaScript Const
        The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
        Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.

        Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
        eg.......>        
                const PI = 3.141592653589793;
                PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
                PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error
                
        Variables defined with const must be assigned.
        eg.......>    
                Correct.......> const PI = 3.14159265359;
                Incorrect.......> const PI; PI = 3.14159265359;

        Variables defined with const have Block Scope. 

Use const when you declare:
        A new Array , A new Object, A new Function, A new RegExp


Constant Objects and Arrays
        The keyword const is a little misleading.
        It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

        Because of this you can NOT:
                Reassign a constant value

                Reassign a constant array
                Example
                        const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
                        cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];    // ERROR

                Reassign a constant object
                Example
                        const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
                        car = {type:"Volvo", model:"EX60", color:"red"};    // ERROR

        But you CAN:
                Change the elements of constant array
                Change the properties of constant object

note--- Declaring a variable with const is similar to let when it comes to Block Scope.

Hoisting
        Variables defined with const are also hoisted to the top, but not initialized.
        Meaning: Using a const variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError:
        Example
                alert (carName);
                const carName = "Volvo"; -->
