<!--Types of JavaScript Operators
    Arithmetic Operators 
        + (Addition) -(Subtraction) *(Multiplication) **(Exponentiation (ES2016)) /(Division) 
        %(Modulus (Division Remainder)) ++(Increment) --(Decrement)

    Assignment Operators
        = , += , -= , *= , = , %= , **=

    Comparison Operators
        == (equal to) , === (equal value and equal type) , != (not equal) ,

        number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.
        & (AND)	, | (OR) , ~ (NOT) , ^ (XOR) , << (left shift) , >> (right shift) , >>> (unsigned right shift)-->
