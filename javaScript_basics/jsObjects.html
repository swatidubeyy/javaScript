    Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods In real life, a car is an object.

    A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:
    Object ....> car
    Properties ....> car.name = Fiat , car.model = 500 , car.weight = 850kg , car.color = white	
    Methods ....> car.start() , car.drive() , car.brake() , car.stop()

    All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
    All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

    objects can contain many values.
        const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

        <body>
            <h1 id = 'demo'></h1>
            <script>
                const car = {type : 'four wheeler' , color : 'blue' , gear : '3' , speed : '30km per hour'};
                document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = " car type is " + car.type + " , car color is " 
                    + car.color + " and no of gears in car is " + car.gear;
            </script>
        </body>
        </html>

Accessing Object Properties
    You can access object properties in two ways: 

    objectName.propertyName
    Example ..>> person.lastName;

    objectName["propertyName"]
    Example2..>>person["lastName"];

    
Object Methods
    Objects can also have methods.
    Example ..>>
        const person = {
            firstName: "John",
            lastName : "Doe",
            id       : 5566,
            fullName : function() {
                return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
            }
        };
    What is this? 
        In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
        Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).

        The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:
            In an object method, this refers to the object.
            Alone, this refers to the global object.
            In a function, this refers to the global object.
            In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
            In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
            Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

        Note ..>>
            this is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.



Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!
    When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object:
    x = new String();        // Declares x as a String object
    y = new Number();        // Declares y as a Number object
    z = new Boolean();       // Declares z as a Boolean object
    Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.
