<!-- JavaScript Comments            
            JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
            JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.


Single Line Comments
            Single line comments start with //.
            Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).
            eg....> 
                // Change heading:
                document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";



Multi-line Comments
            Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
            Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript. 
        
            eg....> 
                /*  The code below will change
                    the heading with id = "myH"
                    and the paragraph with id = "myP"
                    in my web page:
                */
                document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page"; -->
