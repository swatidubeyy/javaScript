<!-- JavaScript Syntax
            JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:
            How to create variables:....>>> var x; let y;
            How to use variables: ......>>> x = 5; y = 6; let z = x + y;


JavaScript Values
            The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

            1)Fixed values ......>>>  
                    Fixed values are called Literals.
                    The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:
                        1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:10.50 , 1001
                        2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:"John Doe",'John Doe'

            2)Variable values ......>>>  
                    Variable values are called Variables.
                    In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
                    JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
                    An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.
                    example ......>>> let x ; x = 6;


JavaScript Operators
            JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values:
            example ......>>> (5 + 6) * 10

            JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:
            example ......>>>let x, y; x = 5; y = 6;


JavaScript Expressions
            An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
            The computation is called an evaluation.
            For example......>>> 5 * 10 evaluates to 50:

            Expressions can also contain variable values: x * 10

            The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.
            For example......>>> "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates......>>> to "John Doe":


JavaScript Keywords
            JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.
            In these examples, using var or let will produce the same result.

            The let keyword tells the browser to create variables......>>>let x, y; x = 5 + 6; y = x * 10;
            The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables.....>> var x, y; x = 5 + 6; y = x * 10;
            

JavaScript Comments
            Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".Comments are ignored, and will not be executed
            Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment. .......>>>// x = 6; 


JavaScript Identifiers(Names)
            Identifiers are JavaScript names.Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.
            The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.A JavaScript name must 
            begin with: A letter (A-Z or a-z), A dollar sign ($), Or an underscore (_)Subsequent characters
             may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

            Note .......>>> Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.This way JavaScript can 
             easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.


JavaScript is Case Sensitive
            All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. The variables lastName and lastname, are two 
            different variables:.......>>> let lastName = "Doe"; lastname = "Peterson";
            Note .......>>> JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let.


JavaScript and Camel Case
            Historically, Hyphens:first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city. Hyphens are not allowed 
            to joining multiple words into one variable name in JavaScript.(they are reserved for substraction)

            Underscore ......>>> first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.
            Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case).......>>> FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.
            Lower Camel Case .......>>> firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.


JavaScript Character Set
            JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
            Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world. -->
