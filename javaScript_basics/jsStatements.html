<!-- JavaScript Programs
            A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
            In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
            A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
            In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

            eg........>
                    <!DOCTYPE html>
                    <html lang="en">
                    <head>
                        <meta charset="UTF-8">
                        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
                        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                        <title>Document</title>
                    </head>
                    <body>
                        <h1 id = 'demo'></h1>
                        <script>
                            let x, y, z;
                            x = 12;
                            y = 9;
                            z = x+y;
                            document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'The sum of '+ x + ' and '+ y +' is '+'= '+z;
                        </script>
                    </body>
                    </html>


JavaScript Statements

            JavaScript statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
            Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.
            The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
            JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.
             eg.....>>> above example

Semicolons(;)
            Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
            When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
            eg......> a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
            On the web, you might see examples without semicolons.
            Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
            eg.....>>> above example


JavaScript White Space
            JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
            eg.....>>>
                        let person = "Hege";
                        let person="Hege";
            A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):
            eg.....>>> let x = y + z;
                

JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
            For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.
            If a JavaScript statement doesn't fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator.
            eg........>>
                        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
                          "Hello Swati!";
            

JavaScript Code Blocks
            JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.
            The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.
            One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:
            eg......>>
                    function myFunction() {
                        document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Swati!";
                        document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
                    }

JavaScript Keywords
            JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.
            Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.
            JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.
            Example 
                    var	        (Declares a variable)
                    let	        (Declares a block variable)
                    const	    (Declares a block constant)
                    if	        (Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition)
                    switch	    (Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases)
                    for	        (Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop)
                    function	(Declares a function)
                    return	    (Exits a function)
                    try	        (Implements error handling to a block of statements) -->
